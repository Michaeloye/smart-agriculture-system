Build a smart agriculture system that uses Raspberry Pi to monitor ```soil moisture```, ```temperature```, and ```humidity```. Implement an automated irrigation system that adjusts water flow based on real-time sensor data. Extend the system by integrating a weather forecast API to optimize irrigation schedules.
